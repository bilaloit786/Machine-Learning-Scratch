K-Means Clustering Example (2D, K=2)
====================================

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating a basic implementation of the 
K-Means clustering algorithm on 5 two-dimensional data points using K=2 clusters.

Contents:
---------
- `kmeans_example.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step computation:
    * Initialization of centroids
    * Assignment of data points
    * Updating cluster means
    * Calculation of the objective function (J)
    * Visualization of the clusters

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Run all cells to see clustering steps and visual output.
3. Customize the dataset or number of clusters for further learning.
